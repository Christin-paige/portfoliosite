    <p class="lead mb-4">IndieFilms is a client-side application written in JavaScript 
      using React as a framework. It is connected to a movie database created in MongoDB. 
      IndieFilms provides users with a list of independent films and information about each
       film, including an image of the movie poster, a summary, genre, and director. Users can 
       create a profile, update information, and “favorite” individual films to store in a list 
       on their profile page.</p>

  <h2 class="margin">Purpose and Context</h2>
  <p> IndieFilms is a personal project I completed for my CareerFoundry Full-Stack Development course. 
    The purpose of this task was to showcase my mastery of full-stack web development. I decided to 
    create an app for independent film enthusiasts to have a niche website to keep track of their favorite 
    films while having the opportunity to build a full-stack web app from scratch..</p>

      <h3>REST API</h3>
      <p>I aimed to design a REST API so that users could create a profile to keep track
         of their favorite independent films. First, I identified the different requests users 
         might want to make and determined the appropriate HTTP methods for each request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). 
         I then associated an endpoint with each of these methods.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4"> 
      <h3>Database</h3>
      <p> I subsequently created a non-relational database using MongoDB.
         I opted for a non-relational database for its flexibility when altering data. 
         This flexibility proved useful as I frequently modified and added to the data 
         as new ideas emerged.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4"> 
      <h3>Business Logic and User Security</h3>
      <p>To convert the code from MongoDB, I integrated Mongoose into my REST API.
         HTTP authentication is used when a user logs in, and a JWT is created for 
         the user to securely navigate the site. All endpoints were tested using Postman, 
         and I utilized Heroku to deploy my API.

          <h3>REACT</h3>
          <p>Before writing any code for the client side of my application, 
            I considered which framework would work best for this project. 
            Ultimately, I chose React due to its popularity and excellent documentation.
             As I learned while doing, I frequently referenced its documentation.</p>
            <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>I aimed for a single-page application for efficiency. Every time a change is 
          made or a user clicks a button, the entire page will not have to reload, making 
          the switch between views quicker. I used React Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness, 
          which proved to be a significant time-saver.
        </p>
        <h3>Deployment and Hosting</h3>
        <p class="pb-3">Since I deployed my movie_api using Heroku, I decided to opt for a different deployment and hosting option, Netlify.</p>

        <h1 class="pt-5">Challenges</h1>
        <p>I faced numerous challenges along the way, but I am grateful for the learning experience. 
          React was a new framework for me, and I was still relatively new to JavaScript. Every day 
          presented new situations and problems that I had to learn in the moment and troubleshoot. 
          Overcoming these challenges and learning how to troubleshoot has made me a more confident 
          developer overall.

        <h1 class="pt-5">Duration</h1>
        <p>So far, this project has been my favorite; 
          however, it was the most time-consuming. It spanned a couple of months, 
          at least twice as long as any other project during this course. 
          Fortunately, I had guidance from my mentor during times when I felt stuck. 
          Although it took a considerable amount of time to complete, I gained valuable 
          experience compared to completing it quickly.

        <p>I want to thank my tutor at CareerFoundry as well as my mentor who provided the guidance needed as well as her
            time to show me how to troubleshoot when given a red error message, and reminding me that “The computer
            will only do what you tell it to do.”</p>
