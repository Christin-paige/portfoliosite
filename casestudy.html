    <h1>Overview</h1>
  
      <p>IndieFilms is a client-side application written in 
        JavaScript using React as a framework. It is connected to
        a movie database created in Mongo DB. IndieFilms delivers 
        the user with a list of independent films and information 
        about each film including an image of the movie poster, 
        the summary, genre, and director. Users can create a 
        profile, update information, and “favorite” individual 
        films to store in a list on their profile page.</p>

    <h1>Purpose and Context</h1>
        
          <p>IndieFilms is a personal project I completed for my CareerFoundry Full-Stack Development course.
            The purpose of this task was to show my mastery of full-stack web development.
            I wanted to create<br>an app for independent film enthusiasts to have a niche website to keep track of their favorite films while having <br>the opportunity to build a full-stack web app from scratch.

        <h2>Server-Side</h2>
          <p>I created a REST API using Express and Node.js which interacts with a database built using MongoDB.
           The API provides information in JSON format and was tested in Postman. The API was then deployed to
           Heroku.</p>

        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p>I had many challenges along the way but I am grateful for the learning experience.<br>React was a new framework 
            for me and I was still relatively new to JavaScript so everyday<br>I was running into new situations and problems that I would have to 
            learn-in-the-moment and<br>trouble-shoot. Facing so many challenges and learning how to troubleshoot has overall made<br>me a more confident developer.</p>
       </div>
    <div class="duration">
        <h1>Duration</h1>
        <p>So far, this project has been my most favorite, however, it was the most time-consuming.
            It spanned<br>a couple of months for me, at least twice as long as any other project during this course.<br>
            Fortunately, I had guidance from my mentor for the times I was feeling stuck. Even though it did take quite<br>
            a long time to complete, I gained so much from the experience as compared to completing it quickly.

    <div class="credits">
      <h1>Credits</h1>
        <p>I want to thank my tutor at CareerFoundry as well as my mentor who provided the guidance needed as well as her<br>
            time to show me how to troubleshoot when given a red error message, and reminding me that “The computer<br>will only do what you tell it to do.”</p>
